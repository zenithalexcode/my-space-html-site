  <h1>Welcome Rachaelina to My Creative space</h1>
  <h2>where ideas come to life with code</h2>
  <p>This website marks a new chapter in my journey as a web developer. i'm learning to bring ideas to life using the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every line of code I write brings me closer to building something meaningful. </p>
  <p>With each project, i aim to solve real-world problems and create user-friendly experience. I believe technology should be simple, beautiful, and accessible to everyone and this is my first step in that direction</p>
